# Welcome to the cohere-aws Repository

Welcome to the cohere-aws repository! This repository provides a collection of ready-made notebooks that allow you to interact seamlessly with Cohere models on AWS SageMaker. Whether you are looking to perform text generation, classification, embeddings, or reranking, our notebooks are designed to get you started quickly and efficiently.

## Getting Started

**Explore the Notebooks**:
Navigate through the current directory and open any of the provided Jupyter notebooks to start interacting with Cohere models via AWS SageMaker.

## Important Notice

Cohere [python](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python) and [typescript](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-typescript) SDKs now also support Bedrock and SageMaker! This is part of an effort to make it as frictionless as possible to get started with and switch between Cohere providers.

Please see the [platform support docs](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/cohere-works-everywhere) for code snippets and the status of this transition or go straight to the [python](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python) and [typescript](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-typescript) repos to start using Bedrock/SageMaker straight away.

## AWS Security Best Practices

When using these notebooks, please ensure you follow the [AWS Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-best-practices.html) to secure your AWS environment and resources.
